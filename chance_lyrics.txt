And we back
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we
And we back, and we back, na, na, na
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll probably cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third
This is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
This is all we got
Music is all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
Music is all we got
You don't want zero problems, big fella!

Ooh, I be comin', put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings on my lap
 I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap
 wrong with you? What you was thinkin'?

You talk that talk that make a lame a  fall in love
Not me, though, you can keep those
Bro, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so

You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
They be like, "There he go!"
You old
Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezus said he ain't make them
My  chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this  may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run  like diarrhea
Big yacht, no pies there
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Pull up, they be like, "There he go!"
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter,  need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they've been with toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told you
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her too warm
All these  come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
 a watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty , centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
Oh, oh, oh, incredible
I would... incredible
Everything...
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my  ain't had no dad
None of my  ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightening bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawty's act hard
Okay now Dave grandpa grand crossing
First day,  shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma had salon doing perms out the armchair
Yeah we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79, 79 place
79, 79, 79, 79 place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the clerk
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
 up and  all my friends
All my friends, all my...
Stick around
Summer friends, summer...
(You're my friend...)
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around

(So lay your head...)
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing  never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing  never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up
Good God
The blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like...
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
Good God
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in heaven
I know the difference between blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
War with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
There are obstacles in life
Many many trials and tribulations that come up
But you got to realize and know
That even Jericho walls must fall
Every wall must fall
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)

Stay in the line, stay in the line

I got a link in my bio my do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third drought, third carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And you know momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots
I'm the only  still care about mixtapes
Bad little  wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only still cares about mixtapes
Bad little  wanna know how lips taste
Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama
She sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna
She shine like a Rolex, got that from her momma
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these  gon'  off respect and that loyalty
All my  lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me
Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me

They love all the slime ball

I got me some [?] like I'm [?]
And I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul
I'm the only  still care about mixtapes
Bad little  wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only  still care about mixtapes
Bad little  wanna know how lips taste
Am I the only one who really care about cover art
Growing up I ain't have my brother cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After one night the folks thought I was finished
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, I bite like a gator
 them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as it cater
Oh, they  with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
 both from the 6
Give a  about a
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the
I'm the only  still care about mixtapes
Bad little wanna know how lips taste
I said am I the only  still care about mixtapes
Bad little  wanna know how lips taste
Angels, na, na, na, na

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah  famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new  sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
So they  around, sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even have Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you? And who the  is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week,  never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live

We used to roll at the rink
We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'

We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you cause
We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)
We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a , I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam

Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got  to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago  and rocket ships
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)
Shut up! Start dancing, ho
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night

It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great, is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, is our God
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, I rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height, wage won
The poltergeist to exalt the Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
'O son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
Poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
...n' a bowl
We just be smoking
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a, we just
 is going on? When did we buy a bowl?

We just be smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
There don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her...

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down ooh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down ooh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoked to Fetty's song Zoo-Wap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding your back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down oh
I got to lay back the roof
I got to break the new rules
She can't be taking no cost
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me my mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give a perc full of steam
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and geuss
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can...

[Chance The Rapper & Future:]
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down ooh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

And we back, and we back, and we back
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter. I was acting a fool
But who would think their raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head. I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body
Can't rely on myself
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name
and starting missing my chance
LA for four months end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city
I sleep in my hat
I felt hog-tied
ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there, he just siting there waiting
I'll be racing up the stairs. I'mma get to the gate singing
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine
Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid
I "Stand Up" like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much they think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
I said, "It's yours. Don't worry, little bean head.
I'm just here to catch my breath. I got a world tattoo."
She said, "Cool. Just bring me some food."
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
I'm gonna finish mine
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Lord, rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers
So when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So he can watch her lonely child
I know my God
I know my God seen his breaks and his edges
A jacket for giving that painted his city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days he prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love

Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
Never, never, never
Chance, let me in
This thirst in my soul—
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me
Where else can I go?
Where but you? Come on
I may cry a river
I may cry a thousand tears
But you take each drop and you wash—
You wash me new, me new
People sing this water is deep, yes, yes
And I need you to—
Jesus, rescue me
Come on, save me
I need you to take me to your mountain, hallelujah
So someday Chicago will be free
Someday we'll all be free, be free

The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
I speak of promise land
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new  jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-farsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming
So are you ready?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
I got suspended, ohhhhh you got suspended<br>
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14, 400 minutes<br>
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett<br>
That racket over the net, ohhhhh give me my tennis<br>
Shoes<br>
Give me a minute, ohhhhh I can't be tardy<br>
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded<br>
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai<br>
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni<br>
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there<br>
An inch away from heaven, a million songs from right here<br>
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali<br>
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping<br>
So at the school they arrested him<br>
Back seat, squad car, nestled in<br>
Shouts to the bitch nigga Hessleton<br>
With' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'<br>
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence<br>
So far, so good, so special and<br>
No stars, good jobs, or excellents<br>
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon<br>
Ohhhhh you got suspended, ohhhhh you not gon' finish<br>
Ohhhhh you look familiar, ohhhhh you look like Kenneth<br>
Damn they gon' resent it, ohhhhh you representin'<br>
A class of bad kids, 14, 400 minutes ahhhhh! Like<br>
In the real world, we just people with ideas<br>
That shit cray that shit dead<br>
That shit fake blast a kid<br>
Cassius clay at his head<br>
At a boy, at a kid<br>
I'm a need a napkin, cook 'em up<br>
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up<br>
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up<br>
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck<br>
Niggas don't act like grown ups when niggas don't get to grow up<br>
Niggas don't wanna throw hands that's what made me wanna throw up<br>
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners<br>
Niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up<br>
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred<br>
My niggas stay in the low end the others stay in the hundreds<br>
My daddy told me to hate 'em my mamma told me to love 'em<br>
My neighbors told me they hunting I hope I make it through summer<br>
They stole one of my niggas I should have seen that one coming<br>
My priest told me it's angels my niggas told me it's nothing<br>
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die<br>
Going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God<br>
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied<br>
I call him my lil homie he bought him a 45<br>
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business<br>
And all of em' love they mamas and all of they mamas miss em'<br>
And this shit is just stupid this shit is fucking senseless<br>
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive<br>
<br>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br>
(I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide<br>
Hoping that I find you) <i>[3x]</i><br>
<br>
And hoping that I find you<br>
I been hoping that I find you<br>
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World<br>
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl<br>
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa<br>
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connies Pizza<br>
And every year we made a Christmas list<br>
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish<br>
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish<br>
Like "Lord, let me see another year like this"<br>
Let's take it back like Indian givers<br>
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets<br>
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings<br>
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings<br>
I used to chill with the kids next door<br>
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four<br>
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys<br>
Around the bend was Smart Guy<br>
Flipping through the picture books<br>
Checking through my archives<br>
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back<br>
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags<br>
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back<br>
MY$FITS and mismatch<br>
That get off like wristslaps<br>
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up<br>
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up<br>
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry<br>
When they reminisce over you, my God<br>
I still got orange and white cassette tapes<br>
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate<br>
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark<br>
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart<br>
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout<br>
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House<br>
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos<br>
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones<br>
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show<br>
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show<br>
Games of tips taking niggas to school<br>
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull<br>
Round here we lose best friends like every week<br>
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek<br>
And one day maybel I'm a find Terrance and I could lead them<br>
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom<br>
This is for sand in my shoes<br>
Shout out to Oak Street<br>
For the free train rides<br>
Shout out to Polk Street<br>
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt<br>
How you don't see us can't hear us<br>
You Helen Keller<br>
But I'm a save my dollars for Mary Jane<br>
And embellish her<br>
Inhalin' her, Smellin' her, maybe sellin' her<br>
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Elegar<br>
But that's my nigga, my dude be droppin' hella verses<br>
Shouts to D O C and new drive too<br>
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do<br>
But I still save money like a coupon<br>
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on
Another weekend full of blunts and brews<br>
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"<br>
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two<br>
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome<br>
Niggas never need no cup<br>
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up<br>
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks<br>
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal<br>
Tryna get a million<br>
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them<br>
Real <i>[?]</i> nigga mean real appeal<br>
We go all out 'til we fall out<br>
Niggas get called out then hauled out<br>
With the windows down we like to smoke<br>
Drink 'til we fall out, fuck is you tahm boy<br>
The Village is my brothers<br>
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'<br>
Hella love for Chance The Rapper<br>
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God<br>
<br>
And I just want roll, with my windows down<br>
This is six blunt rotation music<br>
This is just got off six month probation music<br>
This is steppin' on the beach when you're too drunk to feel a beat<br>
This that laughing in a condo, throwin' shit down in the street<br>
This that shouts to the Ave<br>
Shouts to the lab<br>
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags<br>
This for every math class that I ever had<br>
So fuck you if a I failed, and fuck you if I passed!<br>
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past<br>
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class<br>
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed<br>
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed<br>
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass<br>
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav<br>
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave<br>
We on the ground yelling, "Get my nigga back!"<br>
Light a joint<br>
Or spliff it if you classy<br>
Split a swisha witcha nigga<br>
If you ask me<br>
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me<br>
Don't answer about your problems<br>
Or your issues or your Ashleys<br>
It's a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite<br>
Rims, Henny, and reminisce<br>
Nostalgia and M&amp;M's<br>
Cinnamon tone women and<br>
Feminine's getting intimate<br>
All broads is frivolous<br>
Homies could get they dividends<br>
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate<br>
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate<br>
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic son of a biscuit<br>
Man fuck this shit<br>
Here's a tab of acid for your ear<br>
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air<br>
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near<br>
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here<br>
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles<br>
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles<br>
Ramadan, I'm the don of the diamond jewels<br>
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles<br>
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo<br>
I could write a fucking book, non kamasutral<br>
You niggas goofies since a conflict that is kinda crucial<br>
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I'm a neutral<br>
But I'm a let the bull pass like matadors<br>
Versus a Minotaur<br>
Verse is a metaphor<br>
A metamorphoses and I'm a fuckin animorph<br>
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele &amp; Danny Whorf<br>
Remember I used to bang with bad ones<br>
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson<br>
Mama said that I was way too handsome<br>
To be throwing the hand's son"<br>
Breaking Walls like Samson<br>
But I'm a throw a tantrum<br>
'Til I'm on Every Samsung<br>
Sanyo, and Handheld and Handgun<br>
Please Put ya lighter's up<br>
'Til life is up<br>
And light it up<br>
And slice a cut<br>
The night is young<br>
It's nice enough<br>
The nicest blunt<br>
The nicest stuff<br>
My niggas out here trapping a lot<br>
I know you think you on<br>
Hiding Reggie sacks in your socks<br>
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock<br>
.4's for 15, yea my niggas we be taxing a lot<br>
Only to goofies tho, choking on a doobie though<br>
My eyes do be low, two be rolled<br>
Remember days of the Rufio<br>
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man<br>
Brrrang Dang to Lil' B<br>
And Bang a Rang to Peter Pan<br>
I burned too many Brain Cells down<br>
To be worried bout my Brain Cells Now <i>[x4]</i><br>
<br>
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up<br>
Or change language and subject change up<br>
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers<br>
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous<br>
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water<br>
You don't think I felt ya hand on my head yelling "call his father"<br>
But people don't hear ghosts<br>
So how they gon' blame me<br>
Money saved me<br>
So I'm a do the same thing<br>
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit<br>
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift<br>
You better not miss this<br>
Over dose, dope and mixes<br>
Let ya throat close<br>
With a boatload of dope quotes within it<br>
<br>
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count<br>
Coughing out blood<br>
Dropping weight<br>
Like I lost an ounce<br>
Throwing words and tossing nouns<br>
NY traveling I'm Boston bound<br>
Bossing 'round homies<br>
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down<br>
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns<br>
Surfing through the Harlem crowds<br>
At the crib I'm falling down<br>
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round<br>
I'm calling out to God<br>
Your little angels falling down<br>
Save me from my darkened cloud<br>
Reach your hands and arms around
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko<br>
I'm off that local, I'm on that global<br>
I often have dreams of being locked in my mamas Volvo<br>
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo<br>
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot<br>
I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot<br>
They gave me 10 Days off<br>
That's an awful lot<br>
I was off campus, but the officer<br>
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot<br>
But it's all good, I'm off that<br>
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave<br>
While rocking all black<br>
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot<br>
Just to make sure that I don't get caught<br>
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off<br>
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off<br>
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop<br>
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?<br>
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square<br>
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares<br>
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair<br>
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years<br>
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here<br>
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is there's<br>
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs<br>
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years<br>
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny<br>
You got me fucked up fucking with my money

Slow whine, slow grind<br>

Hands on the tracks like Choo Choo<br>

True, true<br>
Mami sip a little bit of the screw juice<br>
Or a little bit of that special k<br>
And throw it in the bowl like fruit loops<br>
Hola, mami chola<br>

<br>
Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout<br>
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out<br>
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout<br>
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse<br>
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out<br>
What time that shit going to start or when it end, or who gone come out<br>
Or if I walked the stage, I've been on stage since I could rhyme out<br>
Shows and shows and tapes of trying to get my fucking lines out<br>
So please don't take my BIC out<br>
My book out, my pick out, my hair, my fucking big mouth<br>
You dick head you dipped out of class and now you shit out<br>
Of luck who fucking slick now, and with them rhymes you written down<br>
I hope you get a mix down with a diss track<br>
From Ms. Rownd and my dick sack in this bitch mouth<br>
Give a five-hive to my teacher face and my principal that fist pound<br>
And now you gotta switch gowns, caught you, little rascal<br>
We got you throwing tantrums, when you could've thrown a tassel<br>
<br>
Fuck you tahm bout?...<br>
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...<br>
<br>
Nigga you're a weakling, why you talking dealing?<br>
Like, "All my niggas flip birds!" Nigga, you're a wing-zing<br>
You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling<br>
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking<br>
Dude yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?<br>
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!<br>
I hear you're pockets jingling, it's calling me like ring, ring!<br>
I'll choke you with your bling bling, then run faster than Tink Tink<br>
And all these goofies mad though, like, "Why he such a asshole?"<br>
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver<br>
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga, I'm fucked up out my mind nigga<br>
I stay right off the '9 nigga, that's where they try an' find a nigga<br>
Feeling froggy? Better timid up, harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt<br>
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up, stay talking but don’t send it up<br>
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch<br>
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck<br>
Gimme that cash, that ben what up<br>
Pockets keep that denim bruh like<br>
<br>
Fuck you tahm bout?...<br>
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...
It's been a really, really long time, long time<br>
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me<br>
Label niggas wanna sign me and lame ol' nigga wanna buy me<br>
Food and weed and drink and shit, just as long as you inkin shit<br>
Sometimes I can't pay for food cause sometimes I can't think of shit<br>
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?<br>
Singing my shit like you just said that<br>
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that?<br>
Young ass nigga where you headed?<br>
Long time to get famous, life's whatever you make it<br>
Just thank God that we made it
Dropping tapes 'till I losted count<br>
Coughing out blood, dropping weight like I lost an ounce<br>
Throwing words and tossing nouns<br>
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies<br>
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down<br>
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds, surfing through the Harlem crowds<br>
At the crib I'm falling down, I'm on the floor crawling 'round<br>
I'm calling out to God, "You're little angel's falling down<br>
Save me from my darkened cloud, reach your hands and arms around"<br>
Long time long time now since I seen your smile<br>
We miss you<br>
Long time now since I seen you smile<br>
Long time long time now<br>
Since I seen you smile<br>
And it's been a long time, long time now<br>
Since I seen you smile<br>
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up<br>
Or change language and subject change up<br>
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers<br>
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous<br>
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water<br>
You don't think I felt your hand on my head yelling, "Call his father"<br>
But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?<br>
Money saved me, so I'm a do the same thing<br>
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit<br>
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift?<br>
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this<br>
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it<br>
<br>
So good, So right<br>
Hey baby, so good, so right<br>
You know it feels so good<br>
So good, so right<br>
To be with you tonight<br>
So good, so right<br>
To be with you tonight<br>
So good, so right<br>
To be with you tonight
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane<br>
Go and get your racist on, all white everything<br>
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading<br>
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing<br>
I know y'all don't like everything<br>
She want a night she can call her wedding<br>
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches<br>
Nose diving, going all night sledding<br>
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up<br>
I hope you get some change when you blow up"<br>
Cause honestly I've always loved the way you could throw up<br>
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus<br>
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda<br>
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa<br>
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara<br>
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"<br>
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night<br>
Thank you for this prom night<br>
Thank you for this prom night<br>
I really enjoyed my prom night<br>
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo<br>
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go<br>
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo and snap a couple candid's of the family<br>
Get some cameos<br>
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours<br>
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers<br>
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours<br>
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers<br>
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy<br>
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely<br>
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty<br>
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty<br>
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me<br>
Look what we've accomplished<br>
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass<br>
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo<br>
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo<br>
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping<br>
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened<br>
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin<br>
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again<br>
And it's alright<br>
And it's ok<br>
And we're all good<br>
We're with homies<br>
Any problems, you can call us<br>
It's all love, it's all love<br>

Been there, done that<br>

Don't call it impossible, if you really want that<br>
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback<br>
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back<br>
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that<br>
I rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps<br>
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped<br>
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap<br>
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?<br>
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping<br>
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening<br>
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain<br>
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking<br>
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing<br>
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham<br>
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em<br>
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right<br>
